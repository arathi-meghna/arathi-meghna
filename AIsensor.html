            <h2>How AI Sensors Detect Waste in Public Places</h2>
            <p>AI-powered sensors are revolutionizing waste management by making public places cleaner. These sensors are typically installed in bins or strategically placed around the city to monitor waste disposal. Here's how they work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> The sensors use computer vision algorithms to detect various types of waste, such as plastic bottles, paper, and food wrappers.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Recognition:</strong> The AI system is trained to identify specific types of waste. It can recognize the shape, color, and texture of the waste, ensuring accurate identification.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Sensors often use motion detection to identify when waste is thrown in a public space, triggering a notification to local authorities or waste management systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Bins:</strong> Some AI systems are integrated into smart bins that automatically detect when waste is disposed of and sort it accordingly (e.g., recycling, composting, trash).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Fines Are Charged for Improper Waste Disposal</h2>
            <p>If the AI system detects improper waste disposal in public areas, fines can be automatically issued through integration with local regulations. Here's how this process typically works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Violation Detection:</strong> Once waste is detected outside designated bins or areas (e.g., littering on sidewalks, throwing trash in parks), AI cameras capture the event.</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> AI uses facial recognition or license plate recognition (if applicable) to identify the individual responsible for improper disposal.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification:</strong> A digital ticket or notification is sent to the violatorâ€™s phone or address, informing them of the fine. The violation is linked to a specific location and time.</li>
                <li><strong>Fine Amount:</strong> Fines are determined based on local laws and can vary depending on the type and amount of waste disposed of improperly. Fines may also increase for repeat offenders.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Typically, violators can pay fines online, through a mobile app, or at local government offices.</li>
            </ul>
